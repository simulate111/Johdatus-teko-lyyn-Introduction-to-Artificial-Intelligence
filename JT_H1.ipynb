        "The A * search algorithm requires a heuristic estimation function h(n) i.e. a cost estimate, from the state under study to the target state. A typical solution for a game is about 20 moves long and its branching factor i.e. how many moves can be performed on average in one turn is 2.66. This means that a thorough search from the depth of 20 movements goes through $2.66 ^ {20} = 3.15 * 10 ^ {8}$ space. For this reason, it is especially important to find the best possible heuristic function for an 8-puzzle game. Good options for heuristic functions are **Hamming distance**, **city-block distance** (also known as manhattan distance) and **Euclidean distance**.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Hamming distance for the situation in Figure 2 is $h_ {1}(n) = 4$, because four of the initial state tiles are in the wrong places compared to the target state. The city-block distance is calculated for Figure 2 as follows: $ h_ {2} (n) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 8$. The Euclidean distance, in turn, for the situation in Figure 2 is: $h_ {3}(n) = 1 + 0 + 0 + \\sqrt {5} + \\sqrt {2} + 0 + 2 + 0 \\approx 6.65$. The blank tile in the initial state has no effect on the values of the heuristic functions.\n",
